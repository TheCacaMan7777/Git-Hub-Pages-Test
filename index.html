    <h1>Quick Hummus Recipe!</h1>
    
    
    <p>
    ⚫ This recipe makes quick, tasty hummus, with no messing. It has been adapted from a number of different recipes that I have read over the years.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    ⚫ Hummus is a delicious thick paste used heavily in Greek and Middle Eastern dishes. It is very tasty with salad, grilled meats and pitta breads.
    </p>
    
    <p>⚪ 𝐈𝐧𝐠𝐫𝐞𝐝𝐢𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐬</p>
    <li> 1 can (400g) of chick peas (garbanzo beans)</li>
    <li> 175g of tahini</li>
    <li> 6 sundried tomatoes</li>
    <li> Half a red pepper</li>
    <li> A pinch of cayenne pepper</li>
    <li> 1 clove of garlic</li>
    <li> A dash of olive oil</li>

    <p>⚪ Instructions</p>
    <li>1. Remove the skin from the garlic, and chop coarsely</li>
    <li>2. Remove all the seeds and stalk from the pepper, and chop coarsely </li>
    <li>3. Add all the ingredients into a food processor</li>
    <li>4. Process all the ingredients into a paste</li>
    <li>5. If you want a coarse "chunky" hummus, process it for a short time</li>
    <li>6. If you want a smooth hummus, process it for a longer time</li>

    <p>⚫ For a different flavour, you could try blending in a small measure of lemon and coriander, chili pepper, lime and chipotle, harissa and mint, or spinach and feta cheese. Experiment and see what works for you.</p>

    <p>⚪ Storage</p>
    <li>Refrigerate the finished hummus in a sealed container. You should be able to use it for about a week after you've made it. If it starts to become fizzy, you should definitely discard it.</li>
    <li>Hummus is suitable for freezing; you should thaw it and use it within a couple of months.</li>
